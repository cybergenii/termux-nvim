### Termux Installation

Termux is an Android application that provides a full-fledged Linux terminal emulator environment on your Android device.
when FDroid is installed,
install the following packages from F-droid

### Download setup script

 the setup script contains all the commands that you would need to setup Termux, install common language servers and download Neovim and setup Neovim

- [use this link to download the shell script](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mGu6xzJUPi4VaKBi-8IseojU_AvW8HdT/view?usp=drive_link)
- [or more advanced installation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13-Ik8qVEcYwGVPyvQqx1f4EUeGccjoxT/view?usp=drive_link)
 a peak at the shell script is shown below

  ```bash

# !/bin/sh

# Welcome to shell script for Termux startup and Neovim setup

### Termux Setup

At this point, it is assumed that termux is installed, and the shell script is downloaded and it's in your downloads folder.
to learn more about terminal commands check the terminal commands section [here](#terminal-commands)

- first we setup storage copy this command: `termux-setup-storage` then paste it into Termux and hit the enter key
- second we navigate to the script downloaded from my drive [here](#download-setup-script)
- thirdly navigate to the downloaded file path in Termux; if your file folder default location is downloads, use this commands: just copy and paste in Termux `cd && cd downloads`
- for more reference on terminal commands check [here](#terminal-commands)
- run this command the moment you are in the `nv.sh` file location directory: where you downloaded the files to `bash nv.sh`
- disclaimer: termux has just a few file directories it can access in your storage folder they are:
  - dcim
  - downloads
  - movies
  - music
  - pictures
  - shared
when you see the installation finished message we will then move to Neovim
